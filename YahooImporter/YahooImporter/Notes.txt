Usage:
The importer will push all fundamental/technical data into a single flat file called Symbol.Technical.DateTime.txt and it will push the 
time series data into another file called Symbol.TimeSeries.DateTime.txt.  It will also produce a SymbolsAndIndustries.txt which contains the mappings of 
symbols to their respective industries, sectors, and subsectors.  

To use the in the normal mode (all symbols requested), just start it up and go.  In order to run it in selective mode, open the YahooImporterDefaultConfig.txt
change the line ${.AppName}.SubsetMode=true and then place the symbols of choice into the next line ${.AppName}.SymbolSubset=XOM,CVX,  then start the program
as normal.  You must change the SubsetMode to false when you are ready to return to normal operating mode.
